The "structure" of the example is based on the book (page 56). The "cardNumber" subject has been replaced with "smoothieDrink" for this assignment.

Example
static void Start (int smoothieDrink)
{
    switch (smoothieDrink)
    {
        case 3:
            Console.Writeline ("Fruit");
            break;
        case 2:
            Console.Writeline ("Veggie");
            break;
        case 1:
            Console.Writeline ("Meat");
            break;
        default:    // Any other smoothieDrink
            Console.Writeline (smoothieDrink);
            break;
    }
}

The "structure" of the example is based on the Unity Tutorial. The "intelligence" subject has been replaced with "smoothieDrink" for this assignment.

Example
public class Smoothies : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int smoothieDrink = 3;


    void Start()
    {
        switch (smoothieDrink)
        {
            case 3:
                print ("A healthy smoothie that contains a lot of Vitamin C!");
                break;
            case 2:
                print ("A healthy smoothie that's really... leafy... it's still tastes good!");
                break;
            case 1:
                print ("A healthy smoothie tha-- wait, this is just chunks of meat in a glass of water! Where's the Manager?!");
                break;
            default:
                print ("No Smoothie today.");
                break;
        }
    }
}

Another example based on the book (page 58)- "When more than one value should execute the same code, you can list the common cases sequentially:"

Example
switch (smoothieDrink)
{
    Case 3:
    Case 2:
    Case 1:
        Console.Writeline ("Meat Smoothie");
        break;
    Default:
        Console.Writeline ("No Smoothie");
        break;
}
